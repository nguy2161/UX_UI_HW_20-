            <p class="col-2">Community Pathways is a non-profit organization providing local food and clothing resources for the members of Steele County. Their mission is to assist individuals and families meet their basic needs by providing resources in a healthy and caring environment.</p>

<div class="The_Problem">
    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>Like many non-profit organizations during the Covid-19 pandemic, Community Pathways relies heavily on its website and newsletter to inform people about its hours and services. The current newsletter page is inconsist and visually outdated, with the signup process being too confusing and complicated.</p>
</div>
<div class="The_Solution">
    <h2>The Solution</h2>
    <p>Create a responsive website and improved newsletter page to boost the visibility of the organization's mission, programs, impact, and create an easier and more efficient sign-up process.</p>

<div class="Website_Assessment">
    <h2>Website Assessment</h2>
    <p>A heuristic evaluation of the entire website was conducted in order to identify some opportunities for improvement. Our group found that there were a number of inconsistencies with the overall website design. The navigation was also difficult to follow as there were duplicates of sub menus found throughout the primary and secondary navigation.</p>

</div>
<div class="Interviews">
    <h2>Interviews</h2>
    <p>To get a better understanding of Community Pathways, our group sat down with the Co-Executive Director for an interview to learn more about the organization, its audience, and its goals. In addition, to the stakeholder interview, 5 1-1 person interviews were also conducted to gauge users' reactions to the current website's navigation and design. 

        A common response that we got from both the stakeholder and interviewees was that the newsletter's placement was unclear, and the signup was also confusing. This highlighted the need for a gentle implementation of the newsletter in primary navigation and streamline the sign up form.</p>
</div>
<div class="Affinity_Diagram">
    <h2>Affinity Diagram</h2>
    <p>From analysis to synthesis, our team used an affinity diagram to bundle ideas from our research together, we organized our data and feedback into three categories: Visual Design, Pains? Gains, and features. We were able develop deeper insights from this method and it helped us gain a clearer definition of the current problem with the newsletter page</p>

<div class="User_Personas">
    <h2>User Personas</h2>
    <p>Using the data that we gathered from our research, the group developed three different user personas, Barbara Smyth, Jody Walters, and Nate Holland, to flesh out the website's potential users.</p>

<div class="Card_Sorting">
    <h2>Card Sorting & User Flow</h2>
    <p>A Carding sorting activity was used to take inventory of the currently navigation items. We then removed any duplicates and reorganized the cards into categories based on content patterns to create a much clearer site map.
        Since the Newsletter was our primary focus we added a tab to the navigation menu and built out the sign-up process to solicit additional emails and addresses to add to the client's databased since this was something that was stressed with the stakeholder.</p>

            <p>1.    Conduct more high-fidelity usability testing to prove ideas and concepts are effective.</p>

             <p>3.    Revisit the desktop design</p>
